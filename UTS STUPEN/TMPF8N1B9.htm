		<h3>
		As lawyers, we know that writing is central to our work. Whether it’s a sixty-page brief for the United States Supreme Court, or a two-line email tapped out in an airport terminal, our jobs require a steady flow of clear, effective written communications.

		But we do more than write. We edit, we rewrite, we format, we print, we copy, we fax, we mail, we file. We take responsibility for all the steps between us and our readers. And we’re liable for the consequences if we don’t. So we’re more than just writers—we’re publishers.

		In fact, we’re part of the biggest publishing industry in the United States. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in May 2018, the print-publishing industry (including books, newspapers, and magazines) employed 731,800 people at an average hourly wage of $44.80. Meanwhile, 1,127,900 people were employed in law-related jobs at an average hourly wage of $52.25, including 642,750 lawyers.

		But those figures don’t express the other dimension of our writing: how consequential it is. Some of us handle issues that involve life and death, or civil rights and oppression, or jobs and livelihoods. But regardless of the stakes, all of us are handling issues that are important to someone—our clients.

		In short, our work matters.
		Because our work matters, our writing matters.
		Because our writing matters, our typography matters.

		I’m not here to tell you that typography is at the core of a lawyer’s work. It’s not. But typography can optimize that work. All writing necessarily involves typography. And good writing is part of good lawyering. So good typography is too. If you ignore typography, you’re ignoring an opportunity to improve both your writing and your advocacy.
